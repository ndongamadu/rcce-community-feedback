It was thought that the collaborative work of all three CSOs at the district level could be an important link to establish connections across the multiple levels of influence. MHEN and YONECO were initially reluctant to meaningfully engage with bwalo forums, viewing these as being outside their scope of work. In order to garner the commitment and full participation of all three CSOs in the bwalo forums, UNICEF re-positioned the activity as a collaborative effort central to the project, and made the roles and responsibilities of each CSO explicit.",,Context components,Engaging civil society and local organisations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
