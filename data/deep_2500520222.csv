Second strategy: Community-Led Self-Administrated Second
Dose (used on the islands). This was considered a good strategy by
some participants on the islands, one on the lake shore and a few in
the zimboweras. 

However, a few participants from the islands noted that the use of Ziplock bags may be a ‘‘bad idea”, as they thought that all vaccine users should take OCV under direct medical supervision. 

One participant mentioned that relying on traditional leaders was only possible if they were trained:
‘‘If the community leaders are well- trained then they can be given
a chance to help us take the vaccine and taking two doses of vac-
cine at different times” [Woman, Chisi island]

Another participant said that changing previously scheduled
dates for the second vaccination round worried him.",,Factors,Geographic and infrastructure,Rural,,,Malawi,Malawi,Zomba,Zomba,,,2016-03-06,* Very helpful content/Very detailed article,Acceptibility,Affective attitude,Disease,Cholera,Decrease,Enable,Discourage,,
